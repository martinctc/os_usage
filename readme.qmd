## Summary

This repo demos an automated workflow using Quarto, R, and GitHub Actions to download usage numbers for R and Python libraries from CRAN and PyPI respectively.

The report is updated every two weeks, or whenever there is a push to the `main` branch. 

See `.github/workflows/main.yaml` on the GitHub Action used to run the report.
